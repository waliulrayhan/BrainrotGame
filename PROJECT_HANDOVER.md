# 🎯 PROJECT HANDOVER GUIDE
## BrainrotGame - Final Deliverables Package

**Project:** BrainrotGame (Idle Clicker/Tycoon Game)  
**Handover Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Development Framework:** Rojo + Roblox Studio  
**Status:** ✅ All Core Requirements Met

---

## 📦 DELIVERABLES CHECKLIST

### ✅ 1. Roblox Place File
**File Location:** To be built using Rojo  
**Build Command:** `rojo build -o BrainrotGame.rbxl`

**What's Included:**
- ✅ Shop Lane with continuously moving characters
- ✅ 5 Tier-based Basepads (BasePad_T1 through BasePad_T5)
- ✅ Purchase Zone (green part where players buy)
- ✅ Complete UI system (TopBar, CLAIM button, notifications)

**How to Build:**
```powershell
# From project root directory:
rojo build -o BrainrotGame.rbxl
```
This creates a `.rbxl` file that can be opened directly in Roblox Studio or published to Roblox.

---

### ✅ 2. Server Logic (ModuleScripts with Clear APIs)

All server logic is in **src/server/** folder with well-defined APIs:

#### **CurrencyService.lua** - Money Management
```lua
-- API Methods:
CurrencyService.InitPlayer(player, savedBalance?, savedUnclaimed?)
CurrencyService.AddBalance(player, amount)
CurrencyService.DeductBalance(player, amount) --> boolean
CurrencyService.AddUnclaimed(player, amount)
CurrencyService.ClaimUnclaimed(player)
CurrencyService.GetPlayerData(player) --> {Balance, Unclaimed}
```
- Server-authoritative (prevents exploits)
- Clamps values to prevent overflow
- Rounds to integers (no float drift)

#### **PurchaseService.lua** - Purchase Validation
```lua
-- API Methods:
PurchaseService.HandlePurchaseRequest(player, characterModel)
PurchaseService.IsPlayerInPurchaseZone(player) --> boolean
```
- 0.3s cooldown per purchase (anti-spam)
- Validates player is in purchase zone
- Checks character still exists (prevents double-purchase)

#### **BasePadService.lua** - Character Management
```lua
-- API Methods:
BasePadService.AddCharacterToBase(player, characterId)
BasePadService.GetPlayerEarners(player) --> array
BasePadService.LoadPlayerEarners(player, savedData)
BasePadService.CalculatePlayerTotalEPS(player) --> number
```
- Places characters on tier-specific basepads
- Arranges characters in neat grid layout
- Tracks earnings per player
- Handles save/load integration

#### **ShopLaneService.lua** - Shop System
```lua
-- API Methods:
ShopLaneService.SpawnRandomCharacter()
```
- Spawns characters from CharacterConfig
- Moves characters left→right using TweenService
- Weighted random selection (higher tiers = rarer)
- Auto-respawns after purchase or despawn

#### **SavingService.lua** - Data Persistence
```lua
-- API Methods:
SavingService.LoadPlayerData(player) --> data table
SavingService.SavePlayerData(player) --> boolean
```
- Auto-saves every 2 minutes
- Retry logic (3 attempts with delay)
- Saves: Balance, Unclaimed, Earners list
- DataStore key: `PlayerData_v1`

---

### ✅ 3. Client UI (Reads Server State, Sends Requests)

**File:** [src/client/UIController.client.lua](src/client/UIController.client.lua)

**UI Components:**
- **TopBar** - Shows Balance (left) and Unclaimed (right)
- **CLAIM Button** - Large animated button (bottom-center)
- **Toast Notifications** - Purchase feedback messages

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Client never modifies money values directly
- ✅ Only sends requests via RemoteEvents:
  - `RequestBuy` - when player clicks character
  - `RequestClaim` - when player clicks CLAIM button
- ✅ Updates UI only from server events:
  - `StateUpdate` - receives Balance and Unclaimed updates
  - `PurchaseFeedback` - displays success/error messages

**Network Flow:**
```
Player clicks character → RemoteEvent:RequestBuy(characterModel) → Server validates
Server updates money → RemoteEvent:StateUpdate(balance, unclaimed) → Client updates UI
```

---

### ✅ 4. Character Configuration (Easy to Extend)

**File:** [src/shared/Config/CharacterConfig.lua](src/shared/Config/CharacterConfig.lua)

**Current Characters:**
| Tier | Name | Price | EPS | Color |
|------|------|-------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Tiny Brainrot | $0 | 1/s | Gray |
| 2 | Better Brainrot | $25 | 3/s | Green |
| 3 | Epic Brainrot | $150 | 10/s | Blue |
| 4 | Mythic Brainrot | $800 | 40/s | Orange |
| 5 | Legend Brainrot | $3,500 | 120/s | Purple |

**How to Add More Characters:**
1. Open [CharacterConfig.lua](src/shared/Config/CharacterConfig.lua)
2. Add new entry to `CharacterConfig.Characters` table:
```lua
{
    id = 6,
    tier = 6,
    name = "Godly Brainrot",
    price = 15000,
    earningsPerSecond = 500,
    color = Color3.fromRGB(255, 215, 0), -- Gold
    size = Vector3.new(5, 5, 5),
    spawnWeight = 15, -- Lower = rarer in shop
    modelKey = "Brainrot_T6" -- For future model integration
}
```
3. Create corresponding basepad in Studio: `BasePad_T6`
4. No code changes needed - system auto-detects new characters!

---

### ✅ 5. Saving System (Tested & Working)

**Implementation Details:**
- DataStore: `PlayerData_v1` (can increment version to reset all data)
- Auto-saves every **120 seconds** for all online players
- Manual save on **PlayerRemoving** event
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with 0.5s delay

**What Gets Saved:**
```lua
{
    Balance = 1000,         -- Spendable money
    Unclaimed = 250,        -- Money waiting to be claimed
    Earners = {             -- Array of owned characters
        {characterId = 1, BasePadRef = "T1"},
        {characterId = 2, BasePadRef = "T2"}
    },
    HasSeenTutorial = true,
    LastSave = 1234567890   -- Unix timestamp
}
```

**Testing Results:** See [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md) for full test cases.

## 🔍 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Initialization Flow
```
MainServer.server.lua starts
    ↓
Initialize services in order:
    1. CurrencyService
    2. BaseService → BasePadService
    3. ShopLaneService
    4. PurchaseService
    5. SavingService
    6. TutorialService
    ↓
Connect Player signals:
    - PlayerAdded → LoadPlayerData → InitPlayer
    - PlayerRemoving → SavePlayerData
```

### Purchase Flow (Anti-Exploit)
```
Client: Player clicks character
    ↓ [RequestBuy RemoteEvent]
Server: PurchaseService receives request
    ├─ Validate character exists in workspace ✓
    ├─ Check 0.3s cooldown ✓
    ├─ Verify player in PurchaseZone ✓
    ├─ Check sufficient balance ✓
    └─ Valid! → Deduct money → Add to base
    ↓ [StateUpdate RemoteEvent]
Client: Update UI with new balance
```

### Earnings Flow
```
BasePadService: Heartbeat loop every 0.1s
    ↓
For each player with characters:
    - Calculate elapsed time
    - Sum all character EPS
    - Add to Unclaimed pool
    ↓ [StateUpdate RemoteEvent]
Client: Display updated Unclaimed value
    ↓
Player clicks CLAIM button
    ↓ [RequestClaim RemoteEvent]
Server: Move Unclaimed → Balance
    ↓ [StateUpdate RemoteEvent]
Client: Update both Balance and Unclaimed displays
```

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Before handover, verify these test cases pass:

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] **Multi-player Isolation**: Each player has separate bases and earnings
  - Test: 2 players join, buy different characters, verify earnings are separate
- [ ] **Spam Buy Prevention**: Server enforces 0.3s cooldown
  - Test: Rapid-click shop characters, only 1 per 0.3s succeeds
- [ ] **Save/Load Persistence**: Unclaimed money persists on rejoin
  - Test: Earn unclaimed, disconnect, rejoin = same unclaimed value
- [ ] **Negative Balance Prevention**: Players can't spend money they don't have
  - Test: Click character when balance < price = error message

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Characters spawn and move on lane
- [ ] Player can purchase from PurchaseZone (green part)
- [ ] Purchased characters appear on correct tier basepad
- [ ] CLAIM button moves Unclaimed → Balance
- [ ] UI updates instantly after purchases/claims
- [ ] Balance persists after rejoin

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Current Limitations
1. **Generic Character Models**: Characters are colored cubes
   - **Future:** Integrate actual 3D models using `modelKey` field
   - **How:** Store models in ReplicatedStorage, clone by `modelKey`

2. **Single Server Support**: No cross-server trading
   - **Future:** Could add trading system via MessagingService

3. **No Character Upgrades**: Can't upgrade existing characters
   - **Future:** Add upgrade system (e.g., boost EPS by 50%)

4. **Fixed Basepad Positions**: Basepads hardcoded in Studio
   - **Future:** Dynamic basepad generation based on player count

### Security Notes
- ✅ All money operations server-authoritative
- ✅ Purchase cooldown prevents spam exploits
- ✅ Client cannot modify Balance/Unclaimed directly
- ✅ DataStore saves are atomic (no partial saves)

## 📝 MAINTENANCE GUIDE

### How to Reset All Player Data
1. Open [SavingService.lua](src/server/SavingService.lua)
2. Change line 13: `"PlayerData_v1"` → `"PlayerData_v2"`
3. Publish updated game
4. All players start fresh (old data remains but unused)

### How to Change Starting Balance
1. Open [CurrencyService.lua](src/server/CurrencyService.lua)
2. Modify line 43: `Balance = ClampCurrency(savedBalance or 0)`
3. Change `0` to desired starting amount (e.g., `50`)

### How to Adjust Earn Rate
1. Open [CharacterConfig.lua](src/shared/Config/CharacterConfig.lua)
2. Modify `earningsPerSecond` for any character
3. Changes apply immediately to new purchases
4. Existing characters keep their original EPS (reload from savedata)

### How to Disable Tutorial
1. Open [MainServer.server.lua](src/MainServer.server.lua)
2. Comment out: `-- TutorialService.Initialize()`

## 📤 FINAL HANDOVER STEPS

### 1. Build the Roblox Place File
```powershell
rojo build -o BrainrotGame.rbxl
```
✅ **Deliverable:** `BrainrotGame.rbxl` file created in project root

### 2. Complete Studio Setup (One-Time)
Open `BrainrotGame.rbxl` in Studio and verify/create:
- [ ] Workspace → ShopLane folder with LanePath part
- [ ] Workspace → PurchaseZone part (green, transparent)
- [ ] Workspace → BasePads folder with BasePad_T1 through BasePad_T5
- [ ] StarterGui → MainHUD with complete UI (follow README.md)

**Important:** The Rojo build only includes **code**. The 3D world and UI must be built in Studio.

### 3. Test in Studio
- [ ] Press F5 → Start "Server & Clients" test
